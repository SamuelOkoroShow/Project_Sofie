# Project_Sofie
A lot of what I'm still working on at Sophie is board that works excellently with my current set of player cards.

# Mission
My mission in the particular project is to create the coolest representation of worlds, characters and gameplay possible 
The core mission of this particular product is to build something that tells a story
I'll share more info on my story driven world soon enough

* Inspirations
- Jourmungand
- Metal Gear Solid 5
- Casey Neistat 


# List Of Todos
- Get Dashpanel working. 
- Create character data schemes
- Firebase!!!

# Help!
I need some help on this project guys. Looking for some RN work experience hours?
Take a piece of my course for free and lets get cracking
I need to find my dog :/

#Updates
the idea here is to have mutiple cards be pulled from an internal database as once.
I might skew the Scrollview a bit. I still havent decided.
I'm following some design templates for these. So hopefully the come out a lot nicer than 
other cards in the app world
